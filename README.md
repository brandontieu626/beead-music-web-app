# Music discovery website (Beead Music)

## A web application for discovering and listening to music

This project was built using React.js, Next.js, HTML, and CSS. I created this project to continue practicing my front-end skills and familiarize myself with Next.js 14 (App Router). I also wanted to practice CSS fundamentals without using external libraries.
In the future, I want to include a backend portion that includes features like users, rating songs/albums, creating tier lists, and allowing users to write comments.

- Created a minimalistic and retro-inspired front end using React.js
- Used latest version of Next.js which utilizes the App Router
- Pulled music data from Spotify API and latest news on music from news API
- Utilized spotify player to include a built music player
- Responsive web design
