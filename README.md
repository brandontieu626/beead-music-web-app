# Beead Music

A web application where users can discover, listen to, and read articles on music.

## Project Description

This project was built using React.js, Next.js, HTML, and CSS.

I created this project to continue practicing my web development skills and familiarize myself with Next.js 14 (App Router). I also wanted to practice CSS fundamentals and responsive web design without using external libraries.

In the future, I plan to include a backend portion that allows for features like user creation, rating songs/albums, creating tier lists, and allowing users to write comments.

- Created a minimalistic and retro-inspired front end using React.js
- Used latest version of Next.js which utilizes the App Router
- Pulled music data from Spotify API and latest news on music from NewsAPI
- Utilized spotify player to include a built music player
- Responsive web design

- Users can search for artists, albums, and tracks using the search bar.
- View detailed information on tracks and albums such as writers, composers, lyrics, release date, labels.
- Read artists information such as descriptions, top tracks, albums, genres.
- Listen to albums and tracks directly through the built-in music player.
- Read the latest music news through news tab.
